1.Created one main section and added class as main-grid and added 5 article tags in that and added class as article.<br>
2.Styled main-grid as display grid and gap to that and grid-auto-columns as 1fr and 5 grid template areas and padding and width to that.<br>
3.Styled the body as display grid and place-content as center and min-height to 100vh.<br>
4.Styled the artciles nth child and assigned the areas to that example nthchild(1) with grid-area -- one.<br>
5.Styled the images and content inside the articles.<br>
6.In media Queries gave the grid template areas so that it can span across columns and rows.<br>
7."one one two five"<br>
  "three four four five";
<br>
This means 1st article will span accross 2 columns i.e 2 times one then second acticle will span and then five will take one column below that third will span then 4 will take 2 column span and then 5 i.e 5 will span across 2 rows.<br>
